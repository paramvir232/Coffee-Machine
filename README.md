# Coffee-Machine
It is a virtual Coffee machine where you can select coffee and buy it using machine resources.
It asks users which coffee they need according to the given options. Once  users select the coffee it compares the coffee's resources to the machine's resources(like water, milk and coffee) if the machine has sufficient resources then you will get your coffee, and the machine's resources get detected.
There are also some secret commands for the operator to manage the coffee machine. the first one is "off" which turns off the coffee machine for repair and maintainable purposes and the second one is "refill" to refill the machine's resources
at the end of the day, you will get to know your gross profit which is stored in the profit variable.
